## INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY

### Introduction

This document defines the Information Security Policy for "Organization Name"(also referred to hereafter as the Organization).The Information Security Policy applies to all business functions and Information contained on the network, the physical environment and relevant people who support and are Users accessible to the information.

This document:
- Sets out the Organization's policy for the protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information.
- Establishes the security responsibilities for information security.
- Provides reference to documentation relevant to this policy.

With each new piece of technology comes new potential for data security breach. The dangers inherent in using a smartphone or tablet are quite different from those associated with a laptop. Even the convenience of wireless internet has more opportunities for attack than traditional hard-wired systems. While most security measures focus on external threats from hackers and malicious downloads, internal threats account for twice as much monetary loss as external threats. An internal threat could be the deletion or dissemination of
Computer ﬁles related to a client’s case. One employee could also share their password with another, granting someone access beyond the scope of their position. To prevent the intentional or unintentional problems created by employee use of software and equipment, developing a thorough data securities policy is more important than ever. This policy should provide employees with information regarding the acceptable use of mobile technology as well as password security and wireless access policies to protect conﬁdential data.

## Purpose/Scope of this Policy

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the security of the Organization's information. To do the following:
-  Ensure Availability, Ensure that the information is available for Users.
-  Preserve Integrity, Protect the information from unauthorised or accidental modification.
-  Preserve Confidentiality, Protect assets against unauthorised disclosure.


The purpose of this policy is also to ensure the proper use of the Organization’s
Information and make Users aware of what the Organization deems as acceptable and
unacceptable use of its information.

Wilful or negligent disregard of this policy may be investigated and dealt with under the Organization Disciplinary Procedure

## It is the goal of the Organization that:

- Information will be protected against unauthorised access or misuse.
- Confidentiality of information will be secured.
- Integrity of information will be maintained.
- Availability of information / information systems is maintained for service delivery.
- Business continuity planning processes will be maintained.
- Regulatory, contractual and legal requirements will be complied with.
- Physical, logical, environmental and communications security will be maintained.
- Infringement of this Policy may result in disciplinary action or criminal prosecution.
- When information is no longer of use, it is disposed of in a suitable manner.
- All information security incidents will be reported to the Director of ICT Systems, and investigated through the appropriate management channel.

## Information relates to:

- Electronic information systems (software, computers, and peripherals) owned by the Organization whether deployed or accessed on or off site.
- The Organization’s computer network used either directly or indirectly.
- Hardware, software and data owned by the Organization.
- Paper-based materials.

## The Policy

The Organization requires all users to exercise a duty of care in relation to the operation and use of its information.

The Information Security Policy for the Organization is described below:

## Network/Server Security

### Server Configuration Guidelines
- The most recent security patches must be installed on the system as soon as practical, the only exception being when immediate application would be interfere with business requirements.
- Servers should be physically located in an access controlled environment.
- Servers are specifically prohibited from being operated from uncontrolled cubicle areas.

### Security-related events:
Security-related events will be reported to the IT management. Corrective measures will be prescribed as needed. Security-related events include, but not limited to:
- Port-scan attacks
- Evidence of unauthorized access to privileged accounts
- Anomalous occurrences that are not related to specific applications on the host.

### Router Security
The enable password on the router must be kept in a secure encrypted form. The router must have the enable password set to the current production router password from the router’s support organization.
- Disallow the following:
1. IP directed broadcasts
2. Incoming packets at the router sourced with the invalid address such as RFC1918 address
3. TCP small services
4. UDP small services
5. All source routing
6. Web service running on router
- Access rules are to be added as business needs arise.
- Each router must have the following statement posted in clear view: “UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO THIS NETWORK DEVICE IS PROHIBITED. You must have explicit permission to access or configure this device. All activities performed on this device may be logged, and violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, and may be reported to law enforcement. There is no right to privacy on this device.”

### Server Malware Protection
- Anti-virus – All servers MUST have an antivirus application installed that offers real-time scanning protection to files and application running on the target system if they meet one or more of the following conditions:
Non-administrative users have remote access capability
1. The system is a file server
2. Share access is open to this server from systems used by non-administrative users
3. HTTP/FTP access is open from the Internet
4. Other “risky” protocols/applications are available to this system from the Internet at the discretion of Organisation IT department.
- Mail Server Anti-Virus – If the target system is a mail server it MUST have either an external or internal antivirus scanning application that scan all mail destined to and from the mail server. Local anti-virus scanning applications MAY be disabled during backups if an external anti-virus application still scans inbound e-mails while the backup is being performed.
- Anti-Spyware – All servers MUST have an anti-spyware application installed that offers real-time protection to the target system if they meet one or more of the following conditions:
1. Any system where non-technical or non-administrator users have remote access to the system and ANY outbound access is permitted to the Internet.
2. Any system where non-technical or non-administrative users have the ability to install software on their own
- Notable Exceptions – Exceptions to above requirements may be deemed acceptable with proper documentation if one of the following notable conditions applies to the system:
1. The system is a SQL server
2. The system is used as a dedicated mail server
3. The system is not a Windows based platform

### Backup Procedures
- Daily Backups – Backup software shall be scheduled to run nightly to capture all data from the previous day.
1. Backup logs are to be reviewed to verify that the backup was successfully completed.
2. One responsible party should be available to supervise backups each day. If the designated backup specialist is not available, an alternative should be named to oversee the process.
- Backup data storage shall not be on Organisation premises. In case of a disaster, backup tapes should be available for retrieval and not subject to destruction.
- Data on hard drives will be backed up daily, and mobile devices shall be bought in to be backed up on a weekly basis or as soon as practical if on an external travel arrangement.
- Test restoration process regularly and create written instructions in the event IT personnel are not available to restore data when needed.

## Workstation Security

### Authorized Users
- Appropriate measures must be taken when using workstation to ensure that confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive information is restricted to authorized users.

### Safeguards
- Organization will implement physical and technical safeguards for all workstations that access electronic confidential information to restrict access to authorized users. Appropriate measures include :
- Restricting physical access to workstations to only authorized personnel.
- Securing workstations (screen lock or logout) prior to leaving area to prevent unauthorized access.
- Enabling a password-protected screen saver with a short timeout period to ensure that workstations that were left unsecured will be protected.
- Complying with all applicable password policies and procedures.
- Ensuring workstations are used for authorized business purposes only.
- Never installing unauthorized software on workstations.
- Storing all confidential information on network servers/secure cloud services.
- Keeping food and drink away from workstations to avoid accidental spills.
- Securing laptops that contain sensitive information by using cable locks or locking laptops up in drawers or cabinet.
- Complying with Portable Workstation Encryption policy.
- Complying with Anti-Virus policy.
- Ensuring that monitors are positioned away from public view. If necessary, install privacy screen filters or other physical barriers to public viewing.
- Ensuring workstations are left on but logged off in order to facilitate after hours updates. Exit running application and close open documents.
- Ensuring that all workstations use a surge protector (not just a power strip) or a UPS (battery backup).
- If wireless network access is used, ensure access is secure by following the Wireless Access policy.

### Software Installation
- Employees may not install software on Organisation’s computing device operating within Organisation’s network. Software requests must be first approved by the requester’s manager and then be made to the IT department in writing or via e-mail. Software must be selected from an approved software list, maintained by the IT department, unless no selection on the list meets the requester’s need. The IT department will obtain and track the licenses, test new software for conflict and compatibility, and perform the installation.
- This policy covers all computers, servers, and other computing devices operating within Organisation’s network.

### Malware Protection
- Anti-virus – All Organisation computers must have Organisation’s standard, supported anti-virus software installed and scheduled to run at regular intervals. In addition, the anti-virus software and the virus pattern files must be kept up-to-date. Virus –infected computers must be removed from the network until they verified as virus-free.

## Metadata  

### Definition
- When you create and edit your documents, information about you and the edits you make is automatically created and hidden within the document file. Metadata can often be sensitive or confidential information, and can be potentially damaging or embarrassing. On its Web site, Microsoft indicates that the following metadata may be stored in document created in all versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint:

- Your name and initials (or those of the person who created the file)
- The name of your computer
- Your firm or organization name
- The name and type of the printer you printed the document on
- Document revisions, including deleted text that is no longer visible on the screen
- Document versions
- Information about any template used to create the file
- Hidden text
- Comments

### Removing Metadata

- Microsoft
1. Disable “allow fast saves” feature
2. “Inspect Document” and remove flagged items. “Inspect Document” will vary depending on your software version. In 2010, it is located under File->Info->Check For issues.
3. Third party software will help identify and clean metadata from your documents if it is necessary to send documents in native format. Verify appropriate software with the IT department.
- WordPerfect
1. Uncheck Save Undo/Redo items with document. It can allow you to view hundreds of past changes in terms of what text was cut, copied and even deleted from the document.
2. There is no software program that easily and automatically removes metadata from WordPerfect documents.
- Converting PDF
1. Converting files to PDF format with Adobe Acrobat or other PDF creators will usually strip out most metadata.
2. In Acrobat, Select File, then Document Properties to view the summary metadata information within a PDF file. Add further restrictions on how the document can be accessed, used, copied and printed in the Security Options settings as needed.
