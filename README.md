# Information Security Policy

During this time of Pandemic crisis as global health and economy disrupts continuously, there's a lurking threat rising in the digital zone. The risk of Cyber attacks rapidly increased as we started to depend more on digital integration, we became more vulnerable than ever.

A year ago I was solving a data breach incident for an organization and in the midst of analysis, I reviewed current organization policy and noticed it didn't involve anything related to Information Security, so I decided to add it and get it approved.
In any organization employees are the first line of defense and it doesn't matter whether the Organization is large or small, without a security policy it is impossible to coordinate and enforce a security program across an organization, nor is it possible to communicate security measures to third parties and external auditors.
Hence, I decided to share this Information Security Policy document which I prepared using multiple policies found on Internet. 
Hope it helps someone in the community.
